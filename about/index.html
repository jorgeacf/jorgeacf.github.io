<p>

    <h3>Short version</h3>

    <h3>Long and boring version</h3>
<p>In my early ages I started to get interested my eletronics and by that I mean I stated arround ten years to disassemble all the eletrical toys to get the engines, lights, bateries and so foward 
to </p>

<p>
Later on arround my 14's or 15's years old I got the chance to get use a computer by the first tim and not mutch alfter that I got my on computer a Centrino 400Mhz, 64Mb RAM and 4GB of disk drive (YES, I'm not from the age of the Spectrums, Comodore, etc )
    </p>

<p>
    The ideia of beigh able to program the computer to do things widout the change of getting a eletric azard was mutch more atractive and safe.
