Hi! My name is **Jorge Figueiredo**. You can find me in most of social networks by the name *jorgeacf*. 

I'm a Software Engineer and Architect working with the .NET and Java stacks for more than 8 years from the finance to the healthcare industries.

I started my professional endeavours working in the finance areas for two private banks in Portugal, where I've participated in projects to catalogue information, corporate websites, homebankings and loan simulators.

After that I started to work in a web based Business Process Management working in the UI interface, Web Services, integrations with other applications and services just to name a few things. 

Currently my main focus is any matter related with cloud, big data, machine learning and large scale software architecture and scalability.

I have a keen interest to learn as much as I can related with the Hadoop Ecosystem. 

When I'm not with my hands on a computer keyboard I have two main hobbies:

* Electronics currently with focus on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 
* Everything that flies and by that I mean drones, radio-controlled air-planes and ultra-light air-planes.
