Hi there. My name is Jorge. This is my first blog post. 

<!--more-->

I intend to be posting very often here in the following times especially regarding Big Data and Machine learning because those are my current main technical interests.

This is something that I've been planning for quite a long time, however it never came to something real until now.

The main reason to start blogging more often is a way to revisit some basic concepts of computer science that might not be fresh in my mind but also to study new concepts and technologies especially the ones related with Big Data and Machine Learning.

Stay tuned.

Cheers,
Jorge
