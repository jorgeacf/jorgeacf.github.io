Hi there. My name is Jorge. This is my first blog post. 

<!--more-->

I intend to be posting very often here is the following times specially regarding Big Data and Machine learning.

This is something that I've been planning for quite a long time, however it never came to something real until now.

The main reason to start blogging more often is a way to revisited some basic concepts of computer science that are not fresh in my mind but also to study new concepts and technologies especially the ones related with Big Data and Machine Learning.

Stay tuned.

Jorge
